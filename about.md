Born in 1996 in Ehime, Japan.  
I graduated the Graduate School of Design at Kyushu University, where I studied new media art with a focus on [“squid display”](https://youtu.be/jatyPk5gpjw){:target="_blank"} which the sound signal gets displayed as visual expressions with squid surface. I am currently continuing my research at Tokyo University of the Arts as a research assistant.
