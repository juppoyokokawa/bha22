We split into two groups, and built a clean bench.  
Details are in the week3 summary.

He exhibited it at Linz after that.

→They are not two separate conceptions, but intertwined.  

Cyanobacteria are ideal model organisms for studying the biological clock.  
Temporal circadian rhythm（概日リズム） and spatial colony pattern arrangement.

Circadian rhythm is a concept that would not exist without the metaphor of an artificial device: clock.  
He wanted to use STS to study how the device metaphor is used in biology, but he became a molecular biologist.    

Three important genes (proteins) are involved in circadian rhythms.  
  
“Then, cyanobacteria collected from my neighboring ponds were inoculated onto the cutout positions from which sentences with first person or subjective expressions had been excised. They gradually grow over paper-cutouts with slow motility, as if they (analyzed target in the research paper) were hacking the paper.”  
  
Identity and archival issues in bioart.
