## note  
**18:30- Guest Lecture: DIY lab building Urs Gaudenz**  
**〜Hacking Microscopes〜**  

DIY Generic Lab Equipment is a tool for engineers and researchers to learn together.  
A centrifuge needs a sturdy case like a hard disk drive because it is deathly dangerous if it fly off.  
**enacting science*  
  
In the project they did in Slovenia(?) last year, they were also building a Fluorescence Microscope.  

“A Lab is a place to labor, experiment, research and share”  

**〜Hacking PCR〜**  
The interesting thing about thermocyclers is that simple devices that raise and lower temperatures play a very important role in biology.  

Both ninjaPCR and pocketPCR were created in the community based on openPCR.  
// looks like evolution.  

DIY Mobile Gen Lab → BentoLab  
  
**〜Hacking Sequencer〜**  
Professional sequencers are deathly expensive, but they change generations quickly, so even if the new equipment performs very well, it is often the case that the loan on the old machine has not yet been paid off.
