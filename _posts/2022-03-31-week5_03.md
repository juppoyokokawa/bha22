**14:00- Bacteria Hunting with Georg-san**  
Georg-san and I had a hanami (cherry blossom viewing) party. Then we went bacteria hunting and joined [qosmo](https://qosmo.jp/en/about2/)'s hanami party by accident.

I brought the media prepared in week 4.  
The recipe is as follows  
- Water, 250ml  
- Kanten (agar), 4g  
- Chicken Stock, 2g  
  
The medium was covered with walking dung beetles, tree bark, and camellia petals, respectively.

Fungal growth was observed in most petri dishes, but nothing grew in the petri dishes in which the dung beetles were allowed to walk.
Perhaps the legs of the beetle are clean??
