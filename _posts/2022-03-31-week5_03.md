**14:00- Bacteria Hunting with Georg-san**  
Georg-san and I had a hanami (cherry blossom viewing) party. Then we went bacteria hunting and joined [qosmo](https://qosmo.jp/en/about2/)'s hanami party by accident.

I brought the media prepared in week 4.  
The recipe is as follows  
- Water, 250ml  
- Kanten (agar), 4g  
- Chicken Stock, 2g  
  
The medium was covered with walking dung beetles, tree bark, and camellia petals, respectively.
