I tried to use my own Magnetic Stirrer.

I ended up stirring it in a pot.  
  
After about 2 minutes, it was poured into 9 petri dishes. When pouring into the petri dishes, the stove was lit to achieve sterile conditions. Some parts of the agar had already hardened or had become quite viscous.  
  
After the petri dishes were lidded, they were wrapped one by one in Clingfilm.  
// is Clingfilm mean plastc wrap?  
// How to sample? Can I take the Petridish outside?
