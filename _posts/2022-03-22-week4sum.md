<!--   
## Install and Test at least 2 different 3D Applications.  
I chose blender and Fusion 360, which I am relatively familiar with,. I edited the PocketPCR case.  
  
### blender  
I had already installed it, but the latest version can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.blender.org/).

Open blender

Import ["PocketPCR_Case.stl"](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4094823)  
*For some reason, the length was loaded as 105 meters.

Adjust the size and add the text.

3D printed.  

*I will add more details later.*  

### Fusion360  
I also had already installed this, but can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.autodesk.co.jp/). It is free for student faculty and staff. The UI changes every time I visit the site, and I get confused every time where to download it from, so I'll write a more detailed description of how to download it.

Open fusion

Open (In fusion, open stl file from "OPEN", not "IMPORT") PocketPCR_Case.stl

Add the text.   
  
    
## Hands-on Group Work: Design and Make a CleanBox   
March 15, from 5:00 p.m.  
Sakuragi-san, Kawada-san, and me, and Tsuchiya-san and Urano-san split into two groups to create *conceptual* clean-benchs using cardboard, a hair dryer, plastic bags, and ventilation fan filter that resembled HEPA filter.

Our clean-bench and Kawada-san and Georg-san  
  
We asked a person who was actually doing the experiment in the lab to use it and give us her impressions.

Comments:  
- *"It may not need the holes on the side."*
- *"The box is too big."*
- *"It's dark."*

Reflection Points:  
- We should have built a normal clean bench instead of trying to make it unique.  
  
  
## Read BHA_Stirrer BoM, find out where to get the parts in Japan (clone repo, update BoM)  

Since I have access to the university's fabrication lab, I actually built it.

First, I assembled the model with reference to [BioClub / BHA_Stirrer](https://github.com/BioClub/BHA_Stirrer).

I wanted to keep the configuration simple, so I used a circuit with only a fan, a potentiometer, and a power supply.

At first, when the magnet was attached directly to the fan, the motor did not work and the fan did not turn. After trying different distances, I found that the magnet and fan need to be attached about 1 cm apart.

It worked on a breadboard.

The box was designed with [MakerCase](https://en.makercase.com/#/).

It's acting somewhat strange, but it worked anyway. -->
