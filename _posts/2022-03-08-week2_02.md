## note  
18:00-  Workshop: Deconstructing Hardware, Maarten  
Disassemble PCR machine and assembe a pocket PCR.  
※miniPCR is about 100,000 yen and PocketPCR is about 20,000 yen.  

**19:00- Pocket PCRづくり**  
Unlike Peltier, a fan might take longer to cool down.  
  
  
**24:00 - 25:00 Guest Lecture: Paul Vanouse - Hardware Hacking**  

In the 90s, there were exaggerated metaphors and hype surrounding DNA and genome.  
As the mechanisms of DNA were being elucidated, an atmosphere of thinking of microorganisms as programmable parts also prevailed.  
  
Vanouse focused on the fact that the images dealt with in Science are also cultural, like paintings.（電気泳動etc）
  
PCR by boiling water on a bonfire, PCR with light bulbs, relay circuits and Arduino, etc.  
  
DNA is pretty much the same for everyone, 23 and me has rather divided people.  
It is actually difficult to make a straight smear in electrophoresis (the purpose of electrophoresis is to make bands in the first place)
