**15:00 - slime mold arrived**

**16:00 - making medium for slime mold**  
We made medium for slime mold.  
  
recipe:  
water: 500ml  
agar/gelrite: 10g  
  
note  
- The incubator is at 25°C and dark inside.  
- Do not close the lid of the petri dish to allow the slime mold to breathe.  
- A slime mold has many nuclei in a single cell.  
- Write the document on the petri dish first.   
- The reason for writing the document on the bottom of the petri dish instead of on the lid is so that it can be identified even if the lid is swapped.

**18:00 - get scoby**  
I take SCOBY that Sakuragi-san and others were experimenting with.  
   
**19:00 - spherification experiment**  
We did spherification experiments with different concentrations of alginate and calcium solutions.  
*spherification and reverse spherification is common in the field of molecular cooking.  
  
When aqueous sodium alginate solution is dropped into aqueous calcium lactate solution, spherical colloids are produced.  
→The alginate ions react with calcium ions to form a membrane.
