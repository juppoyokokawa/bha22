- Pour plates suitable for slime mold cultures.
- Subculture slime mold
- Sketch/draw a pattern of oatmeal/slime mold, predict how the growth will occur. Inspiration. [Slime Mold Tokyo Train Map](https://www.science.org/content/article/ride-slime-mold-express). [↗︎]
- Compare your predicitions and your growth
- Why is the scientific name Physarum *polycephalum*? (= many heads)
- *Extra Credit: What other ways are there to grow slime mold? Wet paper towel?Tupperware? Experiment.*
- *Extra-extra Credit: Make a time-lapse movie of growing slime mold.*


The culture medium was prepared based on the blog of the [Minakata Kumagusu Museum](http://www.minakatakumagusu-kinenkan.jp/2018/05/22/3976).  
  
recipe:  
- water 300 ml  
- agar 3.0 g  
This time, I used edible agar-agar sold in supermarkets.

I predicted that they move in a zigzag as indicated by the arrows in the figure.

They moved along the edges of the petri dish rather than zigzagging.  
  
- Why is the scientific name Physarum *polycephalum*? (= many heads)  
Wikipedia says the following.  
`When exposed to light, the starving plasmodium differentiates irreversibly into sporangia that are distinguished from other Physarum species by their multiple heads (hence polycephalum).`  
So, the simple answer is that the fruiting body of plasmodium looks like a head, but I think the name may also come from the fact that despite being a single-celled organism, it behaves like a group with intelligence.
