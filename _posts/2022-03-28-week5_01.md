There's a lot of art, but very little concrete application in actual science, and image searches turn up only abstract images.

Because no DNA was inserted - only removed - they are in Japan not considered GMO.

Explanation of Central Dogma  
  
Conventional Breeding  
- Natural Variation in Species  
- Artificial Selection Pressure
- Takes time
- Speed up by radiation
  
vs  
  
Genetic modification  
- Variation all over the Tree of Life
- Results in the next Generation
- Potentially very Impactful
- Strong regulations
  
Even if there is a process of mutating genes using chemicals or radiation, if the manipulation is done through natural crossbreeding, it is not called GMO.    
  
The backlash against GMOs is mainly due to the Monsanto.  
The seed industry and labs don't like to mention GMOs too much because of public perception.  
  
But GMOs have produced a variety of benefits, like GFP to study neuronal distribution and attempts to regenerate soil by promoting plant root growth.
